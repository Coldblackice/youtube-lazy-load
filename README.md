### [<sub>â¬‡</sub> YouTube Lazy Load](https://github.com/JustOff/youtube-lazy-load/releases)

**YouTube Lazy Load** is designed to prevent YouTube from auto-load and auto-play videos until play button will not pressed. Both Flash and HTML5 players are supported, but the first one is handled more accurately.

Based on [YouTube No Buffer](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003052656/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-no-buffer/) from James Fray, but has rewritten without SDK and adapted specifically for Pale Moon.

**Warning! Only old YouTube design is supported at the moment.**
